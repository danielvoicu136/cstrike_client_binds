# Client Clean Binds on default config 
Valve blocked the posibility to execute direct commands to clients.
But we can still hook commands to bind functionality via APIs or Natives 
Example for F , X , C , V 
You can activate powers or items (open shops, ultimate, planting or take lasermines in zombie mods etc)
